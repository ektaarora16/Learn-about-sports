## Definition of sports :

“Sport teaches us development. It helps us learn things such as resilience, leadership, accountability, respect and patience. Lessons that sports teach us can help us develop as players and all round good people too.” – Dean Evans co-founder of The Football Centre.

## Skills all sports can teach us :

Emmanuella Grace, Voice and Peak Performance Coach and Expert at Find Your Voice, outlines 3 reasons why “playing sport is a vital part of our development.” These are:

1. Sport teaches tenacity. The ability to fail and learn from the setback and move forward is a vital life skill. Learning that failure is not the end, but part of the learning experience has far-reaching implications, affecting our self-esteem, our resilience, and our mental agility. These skills are vital for success as we grow into adults to survive and thrive life’s setbacks and challenges.

2. Sport teaches teamwork. Even if you are naturally someone who is happy with your own company or more introverted, there are times when you will need to collaborate. Sport encourages the development of this skill set.

3. Sport teaches discipline. Motivation is finite but our capacity for motivation can be bolstered. If from a young age we are taught the benefits of “type 2 fun” and hone the ability to work towards a greater reward, evidence show s that people are less likely to suffer from depression and experience greater life satisfaction.

## Cricket for patience :

Indian fast bowler, Jasprit Bumrah says that Test Cricket is about patience and consistency. With Test  matches lasting up to 5 days and each day consisting of at least 90 overs and 6 hours, it’s easy to see why! Test Cricket is extreme, though the sport has been developed to cater for younger players. This includes the introduction of shorter versions (such as One Day Cricket) that is played over 100 overs, Twenty20 Cricket that is played over 40 overs, and Kwik Cricket that is for children under 11. Each of these versions have helped to make the game more accessible for younger audiences.

However, the sport still demands patience. In all versions, players must wait for their turn to bat and they cannot bat for the entire game as every player gets to bat. When waiting to bat, players simply spectate. Additionally, on the fielding team, even if you are a bowler this doesn’t mean that you are always involved in the game. Bowlers bowl certain overs (though in children’s games all participants tend to bowl), and the rest of the time they are fielding. Depending on where the team batting hits the ball, some players would have to wait patiently for action.

Patience is something that everyone must develop. Everything that is achieved is done so through patience as very few successes happen overnight.

## Tennis for mental endurance :

Tennis is a sport that demands endurance at any level. It’s fast-paced and demands quick reactions, as well as explosive power and stamina. Professional games typically last around 3 hours and require extreme concentration. Even at a younger age, tennis is a sport that can be played recreationally for hours.

With points decided by the smallest of margins, and the constant pressure of trying to judge how aggressively to attack, the mental strain is huge.  Tennis has regularly been deemed an endurance sport by professionals, who advice training for tennis as you would train for any endurance sport. This requires developing muscular endurance, cardiovascular stamina and mental persistence.

Mental endurance is important throughout life, whether when revising for long exam periods or applying for jobs. Endurance comes in many forms that aren’t all fitness related. The lesson is to work hard and train yourself so that you can endure the tougher times. This will allow you to enjoy the great times that follow as a result.

## Football for teamwork :

Teamwork is a key part of any team sport, and this is something that will develop simply by being part of a team. Football is, however, a sport that requires a strong team which in turn creates true camaraderie between team mates.

Children playing football to develop teamwork skills
Football requires a team of 11 players to organise themselves, follow instructions and use their players to the best advantage. Not only does this take great communication to ensure everyone understands the team goals, but it is also essential for players to know their role within the team. Football is a great way for children to start understanding team roles.  If players do not play as a team, they will get fatigued and be ineffective. A tip that footballers are taught early on in school is that a ball travels faster than a player. The way to win is the use the teammates as the ball to outplay opponents.

Luke Heapes, Head of Fitness at Aura Leisure adds that “being part of a team teaches children the effects of responsibility and accountability. When this is nurtured and taught to the kids properly, it turns into discipline. The kids who really want to help the team over themselves take responsibility and accountability over their cause, leading to better personal effect, leading to better outcomes for the team. The hard part is getting the kids to value the team performance over their own individual performance.”

Outside of sport, working as a team is essential in most jobs. Teamwork is regularly ranked as a top factor to recruiters and is pinnacle to success, as well as general safety and well-being according to locally based fire safety experts FireRite.
 
 
## Running to focus the mind :

Running has seen a surge of popularity in the last 10 years, especially in adults.  With less reliance on teams and other people, running is a very individual sport. Athletic running or cross country running races can involve long periods in relative solitude, and even more during training.
Running is a great way to develop great self-control, mental stamina and of course physical fitness. Alongside requiring physical fitness and stamina, a large part of being able to run long distances is having mental discipline and control to ‘run your own race’ and apply effort at the right time and not be drawn into what the competition is doing. This has huge applicability in the modern world.  With large elements of our life beyond our control, ‘running your own race’ is an important skill to pick up. 

## Skiing for planning and control :

Skiing is a sport that is less accessible to many. Trips are expensive, and they take a lot of planning. Additionally, it isn’t something that can be done at home, unless you live somewhere with either a lot of snow, a ski centre, or an artificial slope. This means even in its most basic stages, skiing takes forward thinking and planning. Trips need to be planned and organised, and outfits and boots need to be measured and fitted in advance. Even if children taking part are not the ones doing the organising, they are experiencing the process.

The sport itself takes forward thinking and discipline. Manoeuvring the slopes is something that is essential to having fun while being safe. In addition to this, planning for the weather is also essential. So is planning which slopes to approach based on skill level and experience. Even more importantly is organising the routes to descend. These need to be chosen and envisioned in advance, along with ensuring the skier’s speed is all well controlled.

Forward planning and control is necessary in school and throughout adult life. Jobs, tasks, chores and life itself needs forward planning and organisation, along with self-control and discipline.
